## Introduction

Artificial intelligence has changed how many people solve problems in their daily lives. 

## Personal Experience

When I started this class I promised myself I would not use AI to solve my problems.  I want to understand what is happening when I program and relying on an AI to solve my problems means I would not learn as much as if I solved the problem myself.

I enjoyed the WOD in this class and learned a lot completing them.  Using an AI to do the work for me would mean I would not be learning to do it myself and I don't like that.

## Impact on learning and understanding

Having decided to not use AI, I do not believe that I have been impacted in my learning of software development.

## Conclusions

I have not used AI in this class in order to ensure that I learn the course material.  I do not plan to use AI anytime I want to learn something.
