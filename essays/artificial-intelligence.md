## Introduction

Artificial intelligence has changed how many people solve problems in their daily lives. 

## Personal Experience

When I started this class I promised myself I would not use AI to solve my problems.  I want to understand what is happening when I program and relying on an AI to solve my problems means I would not learn as much as if I solved the problem myself.

## Impact on learning and understanding

## Practical applications

## Challenges and Opportunities

## Comparative Analysis

## Future Considerations

## Conclusions
