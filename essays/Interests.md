*My personal interests in software engineering.*

I am interested in microcontrollers and data processing.  I have been learning to use the raspberry pi pico microcontroller recently.  This is an entirely self-taught process, and I am able to get the pico to do what I want.  Using the C SDK I can control motors with the PWM controller and take input from buttons.
