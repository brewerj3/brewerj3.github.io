*My personal interests in software engineering.*

### pi pico

The raspberry pi Pico is a small cheap microcontroller using a rp2040 processor. The rp2040 has a dual-core ARM Cortex-M0+ core clocked at 133 MHz.  I have been learning to use the raspberry pi Pico microcontroller recently.  This is an entirely self-taught process, and I am able to get the picot to do what I want.  Using the C SDK, I can control motors with the PWM controller and take input from buttons.  In the future I would like to be able to use the second core in the Pico, as the Pico uses a dual-core ARM processor.

### High Level language Low level interactions

C is a high-level language that allows low level interaction with memory and is compiled directly to machine code.  I love the fact that C is compiled to machine code, making it one of the most performant coding languages out there.  It may be more difficult to port between different operating systems and architectures, but I like the efficiency.

### The future

In the future I would like to learn more about web development, operating systems, and network architecture.  In ICS 314 I will learn about web development and hot to create web-based applications.  Another class I am taking is EE 468 a class on operating systems, where I hope to learn a lot.  My senior project EE 496 is with Mark Nelson in the SCADA lab where I have been learning a lot about networks.
