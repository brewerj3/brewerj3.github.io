## What makes a question good?

We have all heard the saying "There are not stupid questions.".  This is debatable but what I feel is not debatable is that there are bad questions and good questions.  So what makes a question good or bad?  

## Bad Questions

Let's start with what makes a bad question.  A bad question will result in poor answers, or perhaps none at all.  To make a bad question you can leave out context needed to get the answer you want.  Asking for a solution is not the same as asking for an answer.  Asking someone to just fix your code and showing no desire to learn is a good way to receive no responses.
